# Vidjoy

Welcome to Vidjoy! This latest version introduces a partnership program, allowing users to become partners and run their own Vidjoy instances.

## Getting Started

To host your own Vidjoy instance, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the startup script:
```markdown
   ./start.sh
   ```

### Requirements

- A VPS with **4GB of RAM** is required to run Vidjoy smoothly.

## Partnership Program

Vidjoy now allows users to become partners. When you host a Vidjoy instance, it will keep track of all connected servers and automatically update the DNS of the **moviekex.online** domain.

### Benefits of Partnership

- **Improved Uptime**: The more servers connected, the better the Vidjoy uptime will be. With multiple servers, downtime will be nearly zero.
- **Increased Speed**: A greater number of servers contributes to faster processing of requests.
- **Smart Request Processing**: Incoming requests will be handled intelligently. For example, if a server is located in the USA and requests are coming from the same region, all servers in the USA will receive those requests, optimizing performance and response times.

### Future Updates

Soon, we will be introducing advertisements, allowing all contributors and shareholders to earn based on the number of requests their servers receive. This will create an additional revenue stream for those involved in the Vidjoy ecosystem.

By becoming a partner, you help maintain a robust and scalable environment for all Vidjoy users!
